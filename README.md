messenger
=========

The required files to run Messenger are messengerServer.js and ImClient.java.


Run the following command to compile the client:
javac ImClient.java

!!!Make sure your $CLASSPATH variable is set to include whatever directory you are working from!!!

If you do not have node.js yet, get on it. Mac users can do a simple brew install node or brew install npm. It is also available to download at nodejs.org.

Luckily for you, I alread convinced Dr. Zacharski to update node and get all the cool modules on rosemary.

To start up the node server, run the following command:
node messengerServer.js

Easy!

Now, to start up a client you can run:
java ImClient


Type -h or -help after logging in for additional info.
